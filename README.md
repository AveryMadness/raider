<h1 align="center">Raider: Modifed By AveryMadness</h1>


Hello, This is the first real project ive worked on, even if it is off of an already pretty much made base.
I have put hours and hours into this project and am very happy with where i have gotten with it.
I am aware most of this code is very scuffed, and thats why half of it hasn't been pushed to the actual raider github. I will take suggestions on how to improve it, however i will not take original suggestions. I will add things on my own. However, i would appreciate help in any possible way.
If ANYBODY who has authority to take this down would like me to, contact me at averyfd@shaw.ca, averymadness62@gmail.com or on discord at AveryMadness#9112. I will be glad to fulfill your requests.
